#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

1. Click on the provided link, directing you to the microsoft page.
2. click download now.
3. Run the downloaded installation assistant 
4. Download the windowsPC health cheack setup 
5. PC Health Check app state that this PC is running Windows 11.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

   2. On the download page, select the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   3. Run the Installer and follow the setup instructions
   5. Launch Visual Studio Code.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   1. Download Git for Windows
   2. Locate the downloaded .exe file and double-click it to run the installer.
   3. Follow the setup wizard instructions. 
   4. Complete the Installation

   -Configure Git
   1. Open git Bash as an adminstartor 
   3. Configure your Git username- git config --global user.name "Your Name"
       -Configure your Git email- git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   4. Verify the Configuration- git config --list
   
   -Create a GitHub Account
   1. Go to the GitHub website and Click on the "Sign up" button.
   2. Enter your credentials 
   3. Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
   4. Enter a repository name and an optional description.
   5. Choose the repository's visibility (public or private).
   6. initialize the repository with a README file.
   7. Click "Create repository."
   8. Initialize a Local Repository
      - mkdir my-project
      - cd my-project
      - git init
   9. Add a Remote Repository-  git remote add origin https://github.com/Reagalaletsa/your-repository.git
   10. Push Your Code to GitHub

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

   1. Download Python-Download Python 3.10.4
   2. Install python and follow Setup Options
   3. Complete the Installation
   4. Verify Python Installation- python --version

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   1. Install pip for Python-Download the get-pip.py
       - Run the Script-python get-pip.py
       - Verify pip Installation
   2. Use pip to Install Python Packages-pip3 install package-name

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   1.  Download MySQL
   2. Run the Installer
I managed to download MySQL, but I encountered a problem when trying to launch it or run the installation. The setup options do not open.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
